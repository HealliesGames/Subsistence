# Subsistence

My entry for the OLC CODEJAM 2019, Written in <i>C++ / SFML</i>.<br/>
For compile the game, you need to setup <b>SFML 2.5.0</b> in your computer.

Please don't judge the way I coded, it was done rushing.
There's some random comments, possible memory leaking and no use of polymorphism / inheritance.
