For compile the game, you need to setup SFML 2.5.0 in your computer.

Please don't judge the way I coded.
There's some random comments, possible memory leaking and no use of polymorphism / inheritance.
I was going to polish it as soon as I finished the game, but I hadn't the time.

Thank you for comprension.
